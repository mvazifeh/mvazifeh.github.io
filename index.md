## About Me

I’m a Boston-based technologist and computer programmer with a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of British Columbia. Over the last decade, I’ve applied my expertise in math, programming, AI, data science, and optimization to develop data-driven solutions within both academic research and commercial environments.

After graduating from my PhD program, I spent a year as a senior algorithm researcher at a quantum computing company in Vancouver, Canada. I also worked at MIT as a complexity and computer science researcher. During this time, I led interdisciplinary research in large scale data science, computer science and optimization, resulting in several publications in top-tier journals like Nature. My research has contributed to advancements in several fields, with some projects being featured at the MIT Museum.

For the past six years, I’ve been managing a cross-functional team of engineers and scientists, hands-on involved and overseeing the architecture and deployment of advanced software systems for global clients. I have a deep passion for problem-solving and a strong track record of leading teams to address complex technical challenges.

I remain actively involved in the research community, contributing as a reviewer for journals such as Science Robotics.
