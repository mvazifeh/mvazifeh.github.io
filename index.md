## About Me

I’m a Boston-based scientist and computer programmer with a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of British Columbia. Over the last decade, I’ve applied my expertise in math, programming, AI, data science, and optimization to develop data-driven solutions within both academic research and industry.

After graduating from my PhD program, I spent a year as a senior algorithm researcher at a quantum computing company in Vancouver, Canada. I also worked at MIT as a complexity and computer science researcher. During this time, I led interdisciplinary research in large scale data science, computer science and optimization, resulting in several publications in top-tier journals like Nature. My research has contributed to advancements in several fields, with some projects being featured at the MIT Museum.

For the past six years, as CTO and cofounder at Adaviv, I’ve been managing a cross-functional team of engineers and scientists. I've been hands-on involved in the design, development and deployment of Adaviv's tech stack and software for global clients. I have a deep passion for problem-solving and a strong track record of leading teams to address complex technical challenges.

I remain actively involved in the research community, contributing as a reviewer for journals such as Science Robotics.
